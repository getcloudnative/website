Together with Martin, we've developed a training program to help our globally distributed teams embrace these emerging technologies -- and knowing how much professionalism Martin puts into his work, it comes as no surprise to me that his training concepts and material have remained in high demand ever since. Martin has this rare ability to understand complex technology in all its depth, and explain it to others in a simple and understandable way. It's that combination that makes him an extraordinary enabler and technology evangelist."
