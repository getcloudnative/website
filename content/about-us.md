Hello, I’m Martin.

I'm a technical and business strategist, hands-on architect and an enabler of teams.

In my career, I have worked for a series of highly innovative and successful leaders across a range of industries, such as Dynatrace, a long-term Gartner MQ for APM Leader, who proudly names 80 of the Fortune 100 companies as its customers.

Having worked as Software Engineer, Architect, Technology Strategist and Lead over the last  has taught me a couple of game-changing lessons — and I consider "focusing on outcomes" paired with the tenet of "starting out simple and learning what you actually need" through the relentless pursuit of continuous learning and improvement among the most important ones.

As a founder at GetCloudnative, I enjoy personally supporting our clients in turning these learnings into practice to create better processes, products, and services by maximizing the benefits of modern, cloud-native technology.
